<h1>Soooo...</h1>
<p>It's a software I was requested to create for company I currently work for. In a past I created few little Java projects, but none of them seemed "worthy" uploading for people to see them (which I regret at this point).<br><br>
Anyway, CludoDB is a software for simple database managing. It only connects to our company database and it can only be changed via altering the code in <b>App.java</b> file.<br><br>
<h1>This application allows:</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding, removing and modifing data in client's list</li>
    <li>Adding contact info and notes to each client</li>
  </ul>
Pressing <b>"Add client"</b> button does 2 things:
<ul>
  <li>Adds new instance into "Contact info" table, which contains info, such as <b>Name</b>, <b>Phone number</b> and <b>Email</b>.</li>
  <li>Creates new table, named after created client, which contains all details about order</li>
</ul><br>
This is my first big-ish project. It's definitely not perfect, code lacks aestetics and UI design is non-existing, but creating this was a journey that taught me a lot about coding and problem solving,
which I'm gonna implement more in a new application I'm currently working on.
